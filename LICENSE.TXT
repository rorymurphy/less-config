The short answer to the question of license is that for almost
everyone, this library is available under MIT terms.  There
are a few exceptions noted below.  Basically, I used to work there
and could not get even a day of time to build this, so if you refuse to help make the
bread, you don't get to eat it.  Otherwise, it's open to the public.

For Bloomberg L.P., it's subsidiaries, and successors (henceforth
collectively referred to as Bloomberg), this software or any
derivative work may be used only with a commercial license.  Where
any conflict exists, whether directly or in the licensing of a derivative, 
this clause is controlling.

For all other organizations, it is available as follows:
